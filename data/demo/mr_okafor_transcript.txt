Hello Mr Okafor, thank you for coming in for your chest pain follow-up appointment. I know the recent symptoms have been worrying, so I want to go through the angiogram results carefully. The good news is that your angiogram showed normal coronaries, with no significant blockages, and your hospital blood tests including troponin were negative. That means there is no evidence of a heart attack from this episode, which should be reassuring. We discussed how chest discomfort can still occur from non-cardiac causes, including chest wall strain, reflux, and stress, and we agreed to keep monitoring symptoms. Your blood pressure today remains a little high, and we reviewed blood pressure management in detail, including reducing salt, improving sleep, maintaining regular exercise, and checking readings at home. You should continue aspirin seventy-five milligrams and atorvastatin forty milligrams as prescribed while we optimise cardiovascular risk factors. We also covered lifestyle advice balanced diet, gradual weight control, limiting alcohol, and stopping smoking if relevant. If pain becomes severe, prolonged, or associated with breathlessness or sweating, seek urgent care immediately. Otherwise, we will review your blood pressure trend and symptoms at your next routine follow-up in eight weeks.
