Good afternoon Ms Patel, thank you for coming in for your asthma review today. I can see from your records that you have been using your salbutamol reliever inhaler quite frequently, about four to five times per week, which suggests your asthma is not as well controlled as we would like. Your peak flow today is three hundred and twenty litres per minute, which is about eighty percent of your predicted best, so there is room for improvement. We talked about your inhaler technique and I watched you use your inhaler, and I noticed you were not holding your breath long enough after inhaling, which means some of the medication is not reaching your lungs properly. I have demonstrated the correct technique and I would like you to practise this at home. We also discussed starting a regular preventer inhaler, beclometasone two hundred micrograms twice daily, which will reduce the inflammation in your airways and should mean you need your salbutamol less often. It is important to use the preventer every day even when you feel well. I would also like you to keep a peak flow diary for the next four weeks and bring it to your next appointment. Please come back if your symptoms worsen or if you are using salbutamol more than three times a week despite the preventer. We will review again in six weeks to see how you are getting on.
