Good morning Mrs Thompson, it is nice to see you again for your diabetes review. I have looked through your recent blood results and I want to talk them through clearly. Your HbA1c has risen to 55 millimoles per mole from 48 at your last check, so your glucose control has drifted up over the past few months. You also mentioned feeling more fatigue in the afternoons and increased thirst, which can happen when blood sugars are running high. We discussed your current tablets, and you confirmed you are taking metformin one gram twice daily with meals and gliclazide forty milligrams once daily in the morning. We agreed to increase the gliclazide to eighty milligrams to help bring your HbA1c back down. I also want to check your kidney function as your eGFR was fifty-two last time, so we will repeat that with your next blood test in three months. Please continue all your other medications as before and keep up the good work with your walking. If you notice any episodes of feeling shaky, sweaty or faint, that could be a sign of low blood sugar and you should eat something sugary straight away and contact us. We will review everything again in three months when we have the new blood results back.
