STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT (follow exactly)
- Date: {{ letter_date }}
- Addressee: GP name and practice address from the patient record
- Re: Full patient name, DOB, NHS number
- Salutation: Dear Dr [GP surname],

STYLE AND SAFETY RULES
1. Use formal British medical English, third person, past tense.
2. Include both positive and negative findings from the consultation.
3. Keep length between 300 and 500 words.
4. Use ONLY facts from transcript + patient context.
5. Use EXACT numeric values from patient context (no rounding, no unit changes, no fabrication).
6. If the transcript states a value that differs from EHR context, include the EHR value and mark the mismatch as [DISCREPANCY].
7. Do not add bullet points unless the source explicitly lists items.
8. If a section has no discussed information, write a short factual sentence stating this.

NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THESE)
- Do NOT invent examination findings that were not discussed.
- Do NOT replace exact values (e.g., "55 mmol/mol") with vague language (e.g., "raised").
- Do NOT use US spelling (e.g., "anemia", "behavior").
- Do NOT omit safety-critical negatives that were explicitly denied.

Dear Dr Ahmed,
History of presenting complaint

Investigation results
Latest blood tests showed HbA1c 55 mmol/mol and eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73m².
Assessment and plan
The impression was suboptimal glycaemic control; metformin was continued and repeat bloods were arranged in three months.
Warm regards,
